# Experiments with Bazel and Textual ðŸ’š ðŸ’»

[Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) is a nice TUI library for Python. Maybe we can convince [bazel](https://bazel.build/)
to work with it and maybe we can even generate executable packages for different platforms.

## Requirements

The only thing needed should be [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) and a system Python (which is used for bootstraping only).

## How to Run

```bash
bazel run //src:example  
```

## TODO 

- [x] use bzlmod to install python and python deps
- [ ] textual dev flow
- [ ] platforms
  - [ ] Linux
  - [x] Mac
  - [ ] Windows
- [ ] cross-platform
  - [ ] update requirements 
  - [ ] build cross platform
- [ ] packaging
